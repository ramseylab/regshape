The Matlab codes in this directory were written by
Daehee Hwang at Institute for Systems Biology.  They
were used in the original prototype of Pointillist (version
0.1.0, released 2004/05/04).  These codes require 
Matlab in order to be used.  In addition, they require
the Matlab Statistics Toolbox product, because they
depend on the "statgetargs" and "ksdensity" functions
which are only available through the Statistics Toolbox.
