This package contains classes used to provide an interface to the
<code>isb.chem</code> package via the Systems Biology Workbench (SBW)
system.  The overview for the SBW system is available 
<a href="http://www.sbw-sbml.org" target="_new">here</a>. It also provides a
facility for loading a model described in an SBML document, and 
generating an equivalent model description in the Command Language 
of the <a href="../scripting/package-summary.html"><code>isb.chem.scripting</code></a>
package.
</p>
<p>
In order to compile this package, you will need to have the SBW
system installed on the build system and the target (runtime)
system.  In particular, this package makes use of the JAR files
<blockquote>
<pre>
/usr/local/lib/SBWCore.jar
/usr/local/modules/SBWValidate.jar
</pre>
</blockquote>
whre &quot;<code>/usr/local</code>&quot; should be understood to denote
the installation directory prefix where the SBW system was installed.
