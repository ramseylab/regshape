This is the SBMLReader library.  It is based on the SBMLValidate library
originally written by Herbert Sauro, and modified by the SBW Project team.

The SBMLReader library is capable of reading Systems Biology Markup
Language (SBML) Level 1 documents conforming to versions 1 or 2 of the
SBML Level 1 standard.  The SBMLReader class is the class that 
reads in the model description in SBML format (as a string), and
exposes accessor methods to interrogate various aspects of the model
(number of reactions, number of species, ith species, ith reaction, etc).

This class is covered under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL),

The version of this library is 1.0, released on February 13, 2004.
