<isb:docsection name="Requirements" label="requirements">
<p>
You will need the Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) vesrion 1.4 
or newer (or the equivalent) in order to use these classes.
Some of the packages in this source directory tree
require <a href="#extlib">external Java packages/libraries</a> to be installed.
In order to compile the &appName; library, you will need to
have all of these external libraries listed in your 
<code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable.  Some of the
external libraries are needed only in order to compile specific
sub-packages of the &appName; source tree; see the
<a href="#extlib">external libraries</a> section of this manual 
for details.
</p>
<p>
The classes in this library
have been tested on the Sun JDK v1.4.1, on the Red Hat
Linux 8.0 platform and on Windows XP.  On other platforms,
your mileage may vary.
</p>
<p>
Ant is required to use the "build.xml" file in this directory.
You can download and install Ant from 
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">the apache Ant project</a>.

<isb:docsection name="External Libraries" label="extlib">
<p />
The &appName; system has various external library dependencies, that
are documented in this section.  All of the external libraries (excepting
those that are included by default in the JDK) are included with the 
installation of <code>&appName;</code>, in a subdirectory 
&quot;<code>extlib</code>&quot;.
Please make sure to use these libraries in order to compile the 
<code>&appName;.jar</code> library from source code.  Some of these
external libraries have changed in recent versions, in such a way
that they are no longer compatible with the source code in &appName;.
Where this is known to be the case, it is noted below.
<p />
&ExternalLibraries;
<p />
Note that the <code>SBWCore</code> library is only required for
compiling the code in the &quot;<code>org.systemsbiology.chem.sbw</code>&quot; 
package.  By omitting the <code>org/systemsbiology/chem/sbw</code>
directory from the compilation (by adding a suitable 
&quot;<code>exclude</code>&quot; statement to the
&quot;<code>javac</code>&quot; statements in the 
<code>build.xml</code> file), in principle the resulting
<code>&localJavaLibraryName;.jar</code> file that would be built, 
would not have any dependencies on 
the aforementioned SBW libraries.  
<p />
The <code>jfreechart</code> and <code>jcommon</code> libraries
are needed in order to compile the <code>org.systemsbiology.chem.app</code>
package.  They are not needed for any other packages in the &appName;
library.  
<p />
The <code>SBMLReader.jar</code> library is only required for 
compiling the code in the &quot;<code>org.systemsbiology.chem.app</code>&quot;
and &quot;<code>org.systemsbiology.chem.sbml</code>&quot; packages.  
By omitting the <code>org/systemsbiology/chem/sbml</code> and the
<code>org.systemsbiology/chem/app</code> directories from the
the compilation (by adding suitable &quot;<code>exclude</code>&quot;
statements to the <code>build.xml</code> file), in principle the resulting
<code>&localJavaLibraryName;.jar</code> file that would be built,
would not have any dependencies on the <code>SBMLReader.jar</code> library.
However, the GUI application front-end to the
&quot;<code>org.systemsbiology.chem</code>&quot; simulation package
would not be available.
<p />
The <code>odeToJava</code>
library is only required for compiling the code in the
&quot;<code>org.systemsbiology.chem.odetojava</code>&quot;
package.  By omitting the
<code>org/systemsbiology/chem/odetojava</code> directory from the
the compilation (by adding a suitable &quot;<code>exclude</code>&quot;
statement to the <code>build.xml</code> file), in principle the resulting
<code>&localJavaLibraryName;.jar</code> file that would be built,
would not have any dependencies on the <code>odeToJava</code> library.
<p />

<isb:docsection name="Naming Conventions" label="namingconventions">
<p />
A few notes about conventions used these java packages.
The &quot;.tp&quot; suffix at the end of a package name
indicates that the &quot;.tp&quot; 
subpackage contains test programs for
the parent package.  Similarly, a suffix &quot;.t&quot;
at the end of a package name indicates that the 
&quot;.t&quot; subpackage contains unit tests for the
parent package (in the JUnit framework).  
<p />
These classes are all in development, and are subject
to change at any time, without notice.  All classes contained
herein should be considered copyright of the &mainAffiliation;, 
2003.  
</isb:docsection>

<isb:docsection name="Using the library" label="using">
<p>
In order to use this library, you will need to download and
run the installer available on the 
<a href="&webBaseURL;/&localJavaLibraryName;">&localJavaLibraryName;
home page</a>.  When you run the installer, you will be prompted
to specify an installation directory.
</p>
<p>
The documentation will
be stored in a subdirectory &quot;<code>docs</code>&quot;
of the installation directory.  Note that the Javadoc documentation 
is not provided by the installer, but you can generate it using
the &quot;<code>javadoc</code>&quot; program available from the
Sun Java Development Kit (JDK).  You can also 
<a href="&webBaseURL;/&localJavaLibraryName;/javadoc">browse
the Javadoc API for &localJavaLibraryName;</a> on the web.
</p>
<p>
The compiled Java code for the library is contained in the
file &quot;<code>&localJavaLibraryName;.jar</code>&quot;, which is stored in the
&quot;<code>lib</code>&quot; subdirectory of the installation
directory.  In order to be able to use this library in your
Java programs, you will need to ensure that the aforementioned
JAR file (<code>&localJavaLibraryName;.jar</code>) is added to your Java
<code>CLASSPATH</code>.  This can be done by modifying (or
defining) the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable,
or it can be done by passing the &quot;<code>-cp</code>&quot;
argument to the &quot;<code>javac</code>&quot; and 
&quot;<code>java</code>&quot; commands when compiling and
running your program, respectively.
</p>

</isb:docsection>

<isb:docsection name="API Documentation" label="apidocumentation">
<p>
For technical reasons, the API documentation has been
separated from the User Manual for the &localJavaLibraryName; library.
The API documentation is available on-line at:
<blockquote>
<a href="&webBaseURL;/&localJavaLibraryName;/javadoc">&webBaseURL;/&localJavaLibraryName;/javadoc</a>
</blockquote>
There is also a PDF version available at:
<blockquote>
<a href="&webBaseURL;/&localJavaLibraryName;/docs/APIDocumentation.pdf">&webBaseURL;/&localJavaLibraryName;/docs/APIDocumentation.pdf</a>
</blockquote>
Please note that the PDF documentation is generated using
an experimental Javadoc-to-PDF translater, so there are
some glitches in the formatting of the PDF.  At this time,
the HTML Javadoc is the more readable format and has the more
comprehensive network of hyperlinks.
</p>

</isb:docsection>

<isb:docsection name="Source Code" label="sourcecode">
<p>
The source code for the &localJavaLibraryName; library 
is included with the library installer.  You can find the code 
in the file &quot;<code>&localJavaLibraryName;-src.tar.gz</code>&quot;
that is installed in the &quot;<code>src</code>&quot;
subdirectory of the installation directory for this program.
</p>
</isb:docsection>

<isb:docsection name="Frequently asked Questions" label="faq">

<p>
<b>I am unable to compile the source code because of the
asserts.  What is causing this problem?</b>
</p>
<p>
When you run <code>javac</code> to compile the source code,
make sure you use &quot;<code>-source 1.4</code>&quot;, to 
enable parsing of Java 1.4 language constructs.
</p>
