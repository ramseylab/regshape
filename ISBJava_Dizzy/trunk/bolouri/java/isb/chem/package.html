This package contains classes used to simulate the kinetics of
chemical reactions involving one or more chemical species.  
These reactions have reactants and products, which are sets of 
chemical <a href="Species.html">species</a>.  A collection
of reactions together constitutes a <a href="Model.html">model</a>.
Given a model and a collection of 
<a href="SpeciesPopulations.html">initial populations</a> for
the chemical species in the model, you may solve for the
dynamics of the model using one of several algorithms.
The only algorithm currently implemented in this package is
the <a href="GillespieSimulator.html">Gillespie stochastic algorithm</a>.

<h3>SBML Level 1 Specification</h3>
The classes in this package have been designed for optimum compatibility 
with the SBML Level 1 specification, as described in the following publication:
