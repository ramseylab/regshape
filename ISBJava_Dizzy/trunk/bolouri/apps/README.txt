This directory contains non-Java code for all Java-based
applications built by the Bolouri Group at the Institute
for Systems Biology.  This directory contains all of the
configuration files, documentation, and other resources
for applications that are largely Java-based.  The Java
source code for these applications is contained within 
the &quot;ISBJava&quot; source tree hierarchy, which can
be found in the directory <code>../src</code> relative
to the directory in which this <code>README.txt</code>
file is located.

All builds must be initiated from the top-level directory,
<code>java</code>, which is one level up from the
<code>java/apps</code> directory in which this <code>README.txt</code>
file is located.

This directory contains the non-Java resources for the
following Java-based applications:

Dizzy        (in the subdirectory Dizzy)
Mogul        (in the subdirectory Mogul)
Pointillist  (in the subdirectory Pointillist)  

In addition, the BioTapestry directory contains all of the
Java source code for the BioTapestry program, and the 
PointillistOld directory contains all of the Java source code
for version 0.1 of the Pointillist program.

For application-specific notes, look for a README.txt file
in the application's subdirectory.
