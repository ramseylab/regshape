<td><a href="../1.6.4/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.6.4</a></td>
<td>2004/04/05</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an inefficiency in the Gibson-Bruck simulator,
where reaction rates for reactions with custom reaction rate expressions, were
being recomputed after every iteration.  Now, a dependency tree is built of the 
reaction&apos;s rate expression.  The reaction rate is then recomputed only 
when one of the dynamical elements it is dependent upon, has changed.</li>
<li>Split the Tau-Leap simulator into two separate simulators, 
<code>taulea-complex</code> and <code>tauleap-simple</code>.  This allows for using
different algorithms for calculating the leap time, for complex and
simple models.</li>
<li>Made some speed improvements to the stochastic simulators, in the method
where the species populations are updated as a result of a reaction event.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the delayed reaction solver where the delay was artificially 
long in some cases.</li>
<li>Modified the <code>RegisterSBWSimulators</code> program so that
it prints out a message indicating that the simulators have been registered with
the SBW Broker.</li>
<li>Added a new program <code>LaunchSBWSimulators</code> that both
registers and launches the SBW interface to the simulators.</li>

<td>2004/03/26</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the SBML model reader, that was reported by Adam Margolin.  
This bug would cause an error in some cases, where
there are more boundary species than dynamical species in a model.</li>
<li>Improved the speed of the Gillesipe Tau-Leap
simulator, for large models with complex reaction rate expressions.</li>
<li>Made some speed improvements to the mathematical expression evaluation
engine, which will improve the performance for simulating models
with complex rate expressions, as well as the Gillespie Tau-Leap simulator.</li>

<td><a href="../1.6.2/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.6.2</a></td>
<td>2004/03/22</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Implemented expression value caching for the deterministic simulators.
This improves simulation performance for complex models containing nested 
sub-expressions.  Slightly improved the speed of simulations of models
containing deferred-evaluation expressions.</li>
<li>Modified the stochastic simulators so that if the initial
value for a dynamic species is not an integer, the simulator 
will use the random number generator to select the nearest integer, 
in a weighted fashion, so that
on average the initial value is equal to the floating-point value specified.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in <code>runmodel</code> program,
such that the output file format specified on the command-line was being ignored.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the way that reaction rates were being computed,
for the rare corner-case of a fractional non-dynamic (boundary) species 
population, in the stochastic simulators.</li>

<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="../1.6.0/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.6.0</a></td>
<td>2004/03/10</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Added a new stochastic simulator &quot;<code>gillespie-tauleap</code>&quot;,
that can obtain an approximate solution of the chemical master equation,
according to an accuracy parameter that is specified by the user.  This
simulator is potentially faster than the &quot;<code>gillespie-direct</code>&quot;
simulator, because it can take large jumps in time, that will involve many
reaction steps, in one iteration of the simulator.</li>
<li>Added a feature whereby the &quot;<code>runmodel</code>&quot; program
is capable of computing the steady-state fluctuations of any of the
dynamical species in the model, as an optional post-simulation computation. 
This feature is activated using the optional 
&quot;<code>-computeFluctuations</code>&quot; command-line argument.</li>
<li>Made some speed improvements to the delayed reaction solver, for the
case of stochastic simulations.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug the chemical model definition language (CMDL) parser,
where a symbol defined within an included file, would never appear as a species
in the containing model, even if it is included as a participant in a reaction.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the deterministic ODE solvers, for the case of a model
with a delayed reaction with a large time delay, and a large 
<code>stopTime</code> parameter for the simulation.  In such cases, the
initial step size could be too large for the delayed reaction solver to
handle, which would cause the simulation to fail with an exception.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in the simulation engine, that was causing stochastic 
simulations with a non-integer initial value for species populations,
to become unstable.</li>

<td>2004/02/25</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a problem with the translation of CMDL (".dizzy") model
descriptions into SBML.  Kinetic Laws and other formulas are now
correctly output to SBML, with the species symbols in the formulas 
representing concentrations, rather than substance amounts.</li>
<li>Slightly improved performance by some code refactoring in
the simulation engine.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem whereby formulas in imported SBML models were not
being interpreted correctly by the simulator; species symbols
were not being interpreted as representing a concentration.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the <code>runmodel.sh</code> script; 
it was not working, due to changes to the SBML reader 
in the 1.5.0 release.</li>

<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="../1.5.1/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.5.1</a></td>
<td>2004/02/24</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several bugs in the behavior of the progress indicator
bar and the &quot;secs remaining&quot; text field, in the simulation
launcher frame.  The progress indicator and &quot;secs remaining&quot;
text field should now behave properly when the &quot;pause&quot;,
&quot;cancel&quot;, and &quot;resume&quot; buttons are used to 
control the simulation.</li>
<li>Modified the simulation launcher frame so that the progress indicator
and the &quot;secs remaining&quot; text field are always visible, not
just when a simulation is running.  This reduces annoying flicker of
the user interface controls when a simulation starts and stops.</li>
</ul>

<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="../1.5.0/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.5.0</a></td>
<td>2004/02/13</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Added a graphical progress bar and a text field indicating
the estimated number of seconds for the simulation to complete,
to the simulation launcher window.</li>
<li>Added the ability to the <code>runmodel</code> command-line
program, to print periodic status reports on the progress of
the simulation, to standard error (<code>stderr</code>).</li>
<li>Made several changes to the simulation engine and expression-evaluation
code, to improve the speed of simulations.</li>
<li>Removed redundant step in the implementations of the 
stochastic simulators (Gillespie and Gibson-Bruck), where
the expression value caches were being cleared twice.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in the <code>jfreechart.jar</code> library, which
was causing &quot;class definition not found&quot; error messages
to be written to the console, upon start-up of the &appName; application.</li>
</ul>

<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="../1.4.4/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.4.4</a></td>
<td>2004/02/10</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the deterministic simulators based on the <code>OdeToJava</code> 
ODE solvers, in which the simulators were failing to delete the temporary file 
containing the simulation results.  This was cluttering up the temporary files 
directory with old (unneeded) data files.</li>
<li>Added a new launcher <code>runmodel</code> in the <code>bin</code> subdirectory
of the &appName; installation directory.  This launcher is designed to launch
the command-line interface to &appName;, without needing any prior user configuration.
</li>
<li>Simplified the <code>runmodel.sh</code> script, to make user configuration easier.</li>
<li>Removed the <code>runmodel.bat</code> script, because it is superseded by the
<code>runmodel</code> launcher.</li>
</ul>

</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="../1.4.3/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.4.3</a></td>
<td>2004/02/06</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Created a new program &quot;<code>SimulationLauncherCommandLine</code>&quot;
that runs a simulation in batch mode, saving the results to a file that the user 
specifies.  The &quot;<code>runmodel.sh</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>runmodel.bat</code>&quot;
scripts now run this batch mode simulation program, instead of the old program 
that would open a simulation launcher window.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the command-line parsing for the &appName; command-line
applications &quot;<code>ModelLoaderApp</code>&quot; and
&quot;<code>SimulationLauncherCommandLine</code>&quot;, causing an error
when a very short command-line option is passed to the parser.</li>
<li>The &appName; application now prints out the total number of iterations
that occurred in the simulation, to the console window, after the simulation
completes.</li>
<li>The &quot;ensemble size&quot; and &quot;min number of time steps&quot; 
simulation parameters are now &quot;long&quot; integer parameters.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the <code>runmodel.bat</code> batch file.</li>
</ul>

<tr valign="top">
<td><a href="../1.4.2/&installerDownloadRelURL;">1.4.2</a></td>
<td>2004/02/05</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where if the user had made a change to the model definition 
editor buffer, and then selected &quot;Open...&quot; from the &quot;File&quot;
menu, the application would disregard the user&apos;s answer to the subsequent
confirmation dialog box.  If the user answered &quot;no&quot; to the prompt 
for whether to proceed, the application would still open the file and discard 
the previous edits to the buffer.</li>
<li>Modified the simulator engine to prevent huge unnecessary memory allocations 
when performing a stochastic of a models with an extremely large number of 
reactions and species.  This potentially improves performance in such cases by 
avoiding the use of large amounts of swap space on the disk drive.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where the application was not properly handling the exceptional 
case of the system running out of memory during the initialization of a simulator.</li>
<li>Modified the simulation launcher so that when the user clicks on the
&quot;start&quot; button, the response of the button control is immediate.  
In cases of very large and complex models and certain simulators (namely, 
&quot;<code>gibson-bruck</code>&quot;),
initialization was taking a long time, which was delaying the response of the 
button control.  Now, initialization of the simulator is performed in the
background, just prior to execution of the actual simulation.</li>
<li>Modified the simulation launcher to rename the &quot;stop&quot; button 
to the &quot;pause&quot; button.</li>
<li>Changed the way that the deterministic simulators handle delayed
(or multi-step) reactions, to improve numerical stability and performance.</li>
<li>Modified the &quot;<code>odeToJava-dopr54-adaptive</code>&quot; simulator, so
that it is now possible to pause or cancel a running simulation within this simulator.</li>
<li>Removed support for the functions <code>gammaln()</code> and <code>rand()</code> in 
mathematical expressions.  The <code>rand()</code> function causes problems with
the expression value cachying feature introduced in version 1.4.0, and the
<code>gammaln()</code> code is likely encumbered with license issues.</li>

where an exception is thrown if an include directive occurs after a symbol definition.</li>

a symbol name that is reserved for a default model element.</li>

<ul>
<li>For complex models (many symbols defined as complex expressions), 
increased the speed of the stochastic simulators
by a factor of five.  Slightly improved the speed of the simulators 
for the case of simple models (all elementary
reactions, no custom reaction rates).</li>
<li>Modified the simulation launcher so that it remembers the directory
of the last output file selected, when the output type is &quot;File&quot;.</li>
<li>Modified the simulation launcher so that the Cancel/Stop/Resume 
buttons are disabled in the OdeToJava simulators, which do
not allow interruption by the simulation launcher.</li>
<li>Modified the simulation launcher so that different comma-separated-output
(CSV) output file formats are supported, for saving simulation results to a file.
Currently there are three options:  CSV-excel, CSV-gnuplot, and CSV-matlab.
The only difference currently is the choice of character that is used to designate
the &quot;comment&quot; line, which is the first line of the output file.  This
also makes it more clear that the choice of &quot;File&quot; output type, 
refers to a comma-separated-value file format.</li>
<li>Added a new &quot;view model in human-readable format&quot; feature which displays
a model description in &quot;human-readable&quot; format, in a dialog box.
Added an exporter plug-in so that it is possible to save the model description in the
same human-readable format to a file, using the &quot;Export&quot; menu item.</li>
<li>Modified the command language parser to fix a hard-to-understand error message 
that occurs when there is a syntax error inside nested loops.</li>
<li>Modified the simulation launcher to permit the user to optionally specify a 
texual label that is added as a subtitle to the simulation results plot.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the on-line help search screen where the &quot;jump to next
search hit&quot; feature was not working for any searches after the first search.</li>
<li>Added a text area to the on-line help search screen, that explains the
&quot;jump to the next search hit&quot; feature.</li>

parser errors when a macro definition contains a loop construct.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the command language parser, which was causing
parser errors when a loop construct directly precedes a reaction definition statement.</li>
<li>Modified the command language parser to allow the value of
a symbol to be redefined, as long as the symbol has not been promoted to a
<code>Species</code>, <code>Reaction</code>, <code>Parameter</code>, or <code>Compartment</code>

<li>Improved the efficiency of the first pass of the command-language parser.  Improved
syntax error detection in the command-language parser.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the SBML parser where
it was not catching the case of a parameter defined without any value (or parameter rule) being provided.
This was leading to the application aborting unexpectedly, when a SBML file is loaded containing this
type of semantic error.</li>
<li>Added support to the SBML reader for reading an SBML model containing a reaction with an intrinsic 
time delay.  The <code>kineticLaw</code> must conform to a strict format rule.  The application
can now export (to SBML) a model containing a time delay, and read the model back into the simulator.</li>
<li>Improved error handling by adding debugging code to the console, in cases of 
exceptions.  The application should no longer abort when an unexpected exception occurs in processing
a model.</li>

is set to this directory.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem where the ISB and Bolouri Lab logo images were not displaying in the on-line
help screen, when the computer is not connected to the network.</li>
<li>Removed the table of contents from the HTML User Manual used in the on-line help (the JavaHelp
environment provides its own table of contents).</li>
<li>Adjusted the default vertical dimension of the editor pane for the model editor, to 40 characters.</li>
