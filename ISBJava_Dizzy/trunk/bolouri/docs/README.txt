This directory contains documentation of the Bolouri
group that is not specific to a particular application,
and that is not specific to the ISBJava source tree.

The documentation in this directory is in XML format,
which is turned into HTML by a mechanism called "XSL".
The specific type of XML format used is similar to
XHTML (http://www.w3.org/MarkUp), with additional
ISB-specific tags.  For an example of the ISB-specific
tags, please refer to the file index.xml as an
example.
